# Product Context

## Purpose
The UMA Tools suite provides simulation and analysis tools for "Umamusume: Pretty Derby". `umalator` serves the Japanese version, while `umalator-global` serves the Global version.

## Problem
The Global version (`umalator-global`) is missing some skills that are present in the Japanese version (`umalator`/`uma-skill-tools`), specifically newer skills like "Ignited Spirit" series and "Unity Cup" skills.

## Solution
Update `umalator-global/skill_data.json` with the missing skill definitions from `uma-skill-tools/data/skill_data.json`.
